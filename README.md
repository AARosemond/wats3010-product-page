wats1010-product-page
=====================

This repository contains the resources to use for the Imaginary Product Page
assignment in WATS1010: Introduction to Web Development. In this project you
are tasked with creating a single-page site to promote a product: The API
Superstore. The API Superstore is a **fictional company** that offers a
catalog interface to APIs. To be honest, don't try to make too much technical
sense of it all: This is a completely useless company and product in many ways.

But that makes it all the more fun, right?

As you work through this project, you will address several different
requirements:

1. Introduce the product
2. Provide access to the explainer video
3. List features
4. Provide user testimonials
5. Provide ability for users to share links to the product page
6. Call to action link to get user to buy product

To work through all these requirements and create an elegant page, the larger
project is broken into a few smaller Project Assignments. Below each phase
of the project is described.

Part One: Product Page Design Phase
-----------------------------------

The Design Phase is where you must create some **design artifacts** (wireframes,
comps, information architecture diagrams, etc.) in order to guide your building
over the next week.

You must also decide what text you will use and where you will use it.
Incorporate the exact text you will use in your wireframes so you can get an
idea of how much room it will take up and how it will read when positioned
relative to other content.

Be sure to make a place for the explainer video. (The company spent a lot of
money on it, and they want it to be featured prominently.)

**Requirements**

1.  Create a PDF wireframe of the page layout with exact text that will be used.
2.  Choose and edit the text you will use according to your vision for the
    product page.
3.  Create at least one other project planning document. You may choose from
    this list:
        * information architecture diagram
        * project timeline (represented in any way)
        * design comps

All of these documents should be placed in the design folder.
